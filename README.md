## Installing Node.js
If you're using OS X or Windows, the best way to install Node.js is to use one of the installers from the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). If you're using Linux, you can use the installer, or you can check [NodeSource's binary distributions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) to see whether or not there's a more recent version that works with your system.

Test: Run node -v. The version should be higher than v0.10.32
