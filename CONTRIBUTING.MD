# Contributing

First of all , thanks for spending time in analysing and making a decision to contribute to this project.
We happily accept Pull Requests, so here are a few guidelines to get you started.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Optionally create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests(is any) to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the SaxoBank organization.
* The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis.
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks.
* After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

Happy committing!
